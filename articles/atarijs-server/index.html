    Atari introduced a line of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_8-bit_family">8-bit home computers</a>
    in 1979 which included <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_SIO">a serial interface</a>
    that for peripheral devices including 5 1/4 inch floppy drives. Various modern
    interaces have been developed to emulate the Atari floppy drives using software
    on a PC and an adapter to connect an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-232">RS-232 serial port</a>
    to the Atari SIO port. The <a href="https://github.com/bnielsen1965/atarijs-server">atarijs-server</a>
    is an application written for <a href="https://nodejs.org">NodeJS</a> to emulate
    multiple Atari floppy drives and provide a web based interface for loading floppy
    disk images into the emulated drives.

    <h3>RS-232 to SIO Adapter</h3>
    The Atari SIO signal levels are 0 and 5 volts while the RS-232 standard may be
    -3 and +3 volts to -15 and +15 volts. These differences in voltage necessitate
    an adapter to switch between the two voltage ranges. While the atarijs-server
    application may work with any of the existing adapter designs it was developed
    with a simple adapter that relies on a single 74HC14 integrated circuit and a
    USB to RS-232 adapter which outputs signals at the lower range of the standard.

    This hardware design should be used with caution as it has not been tested
    extensively. The design is simple with the Atari SIO +5 volt ready signal used
    to power the 74HC14 hex inverter Schmitt trigger gates and three of the gates
    used for the data transmit, data recieve, and the SIO command signal.

    <h3>Demonstration of atarijs-server in action...</h3>
    In the following video vlc is used to capture video from an Atari 130XE connected
    to a PC with the 74HC14 based RS-232 to SIO adatper. In a terminal on the PC
    the atarijs-server application has been installed and is executed with the node
    engine. The web interface is then loaded into the Chrome browser by opening
    http://localhost:8080. The first drive is loaded with a floppy that contains
    smart dos and the Atari is then booted. After smart dos is loaded a second
    drive is created and another floppy is dragged into the new drive where the
    Fuji Boink demo is saved. The demo is loaded and executed from the floppy.
